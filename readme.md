# REP FOR MY CLASSES AT CEFET-RJ!

It will focus on *Web Development* (HTML, CSS, JS and PHP)! 



## Directory Guide


### CSSLearning
	Both directories is just me doing some random things in CSS for learning sakes!


### JSLearning
	This directory is my online JavaScript class at Rocketseat! I will try to follow the class and test things that I learned. 

	
### Calculator : **DOING, KINDA FORGOT XD**
	Developing an simple calculator in JS. IT'S STILL VERY RAW!



## PLANNING:

1. Learn JS *doing* **|Already know what my teacher is doing in class, tho!|**  
2. Learn PHP *doing* **|Already know what my teacher is doing in class, tho!|**
